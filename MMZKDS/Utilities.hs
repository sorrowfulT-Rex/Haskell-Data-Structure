-- | Utility Function. 
-- Returns an error indicating the length of the array has exceeds the limit.
-- For arrays indexed on @Int@, however, this is not going to happen in practice
-- since it requires more than 1024 PiB memory.

arrayLengthOverflowError :: a
arrayLengthOverflowError = error "Length of array has overflowed!"

-- | Utility Function. 
-- Takes the current length of an array and returns a larger length.
--
expandedSize :: Int -> Int
expandedSize = (1 +) . (`div` 2) . (3 *)

-- | Utility Function. 
-- Takes the needed length of an array and returns a larger
-- number as the physical length, so that some extra space is provided.
--
initialSize :: Int -> Int
initialSize = expandedSize . shiftL 1 . ceiling . logBase 2 . fromIntegral

-- | Utility Function. 
-- Returns an array out of bound error.
--
outOfBoundError :: Int -> a
outOfBoundError i
  = error $ "Index " ++ show i ++ " is out of bound!"
